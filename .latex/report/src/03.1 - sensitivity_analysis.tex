\subsection{Sensitivity analysis}
\label{subsec:sensitivity_analysis}

For the study of the system's band-gaps, we consider the connection of the piezoelectric patches to a beam structure as shown in Figure \ref{fig:beam_piezo_patches}.
The same numerical values for the geometry and material properties used in the experimental setup are considered (see Section \ref{subsec:experimental_setup}).

\begin{figure}[H]

    \begin{tikzpicture}

        % Beam

        \foreach  \i in {0,1,2}
            {
                % Piezo patches

                \draw[fill=white] (3*\i, 0.0) rectangle (2.5 + 3*\i, -0.2);
            }

    \end{tikzpicture}

    \caption{Unit cell composed by a beam substrate and 3 pairs of piezoelectric patches.}
    \label{fig:beam_piezo_patches}

\end{figure}

Intuitively, the presence of the piezoelectric patches will cause a change in the mechanical properties of the beam.
For simplicity, a weighted average of the mechanical properties of the beam and the piezoelectric patches is considered:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        J^*    & = J_b + 2 J_p                                   \\
        A^*    & = A_b + 2 A_p                                   \\
        E^*    & = \frac{E_b J_b + 2 E_p J_p}{J_b + 2 J_p}       \\
        \rho^* & = \frac{\rho_b A_b + 2 \rho_p A_p}{A_b + 2 A_p}
    \end{aligned}
    \label{eq:weighted_average_mechanical_properties}
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{$RLC_N$ shunt circuit}
\label{subsubsec:RLC_shunt_circuit_negative_capacitance}

The electrical impedance of an $RLC_N$ shunt circuit is given by Equation \ref{eq:shunt_circuits_impedance}, in which $C$ takes the form of $-C_N$.
By substitution in Equation \ref{eq:mechanical_admittance_shunted_piezoelectric_patch}, we obtain the mechanical admittance of the piezoelectric patch connected to the $RLC_N$ shunt circuit as:

\begin{equation}
    Y^{SU} = Y_1^D \left( 1 - \frac{k_{31}^2}{1 + s C_p^S \left( R + sL - \frac{1}{sC_N} \right)} \right) = Y_1^D \left( 1 - \frac{k_{31}^2}{1 + C_p^S \left( -\frac{1}{C_N} - \omega^2 L \right) - s C_p^S R} \right)
    \label{eq:mechanical_admittance_RLC_shunt}
\end{equation}

It's intuitive to think that the presence of the shunt circuit will cause a variation in the piezoelectric coupling coefficient.
This means that via a proper choice of the shunt circuit parameters, it's possible to control the mechanical admittance of the piezoelectric patch and, consequently, the band-gap of the system.
In particular, the new coupling coefficient can be written as:

\begin{equation}
    (k_{31}^{SU})^2 = \frac{k_{31}^2}{1 + C_p^S \left( -\frac{1}{C_N} - \omega^2 L \right) - s C_p^S R}
    \label{eq:coupling_coefficient_RLC_shunt}
\end{equation}

By analyzing the above equation, it's possible to understand that $R$ act as damping factor being multiplied by the complex frequency $s$.
This means that $R$ can be used to control the width and the depth of the band-gap.
On the other hand, $L$ and $C_N$ can be used to shift the band-gap to lower or higher frequencies, given that their contribution decreases or increases the stiffness of the undergoing structure.

The following figures, shows the dispersion relation of the system for different values of $R$, $L$, and $C$.
All the plots are obtained by using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM).


\paragraph{Short circuit case}

In the short circuit case, the impedance of the shunt circuit is given by $Z_{su} = 0 \Omega$.
In this case, the mechanical admittance of the piezoelectric patch is actually the same as the one of the piezoelectric patch itself $Y^{SU} = Y_1^E$ in the null electric field case.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./img/MATLAB/TMM_ON-ON-ON_OFF_R1000_L0.015_C5e-09.pdf}
    \caption{Short circuit case.}
    \label{fig:TMM_ON-ON-ON_OFF_R1000_L0.015_C5e-09.pdf}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Open circuit case}

In the open circuit case, the impedance of the shunt circuit is given by $Z_{su} = \infty \Omega$.
In this case, for the mechanical admittance of the piezoelectric patch, we have $Y^{SU} = Y_1^D$.
The dispersion relation of the system is shown in Figure \ref{fig:TMM_ON-ON-ON_+inf_R1000_L0.015_C5e-09.pdf}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./img/MATLAB/TMM_ON-ON-ON_+inf_R1000_L0.015_C5e-09.pdf}
    \caption{Open circuit case.}
    \label{fig:TMM_ON-ON-ON_+inf_R1000_L0.015_C5e-09.pdf}
\end{figure}

With respect to the short circuit case, the band-gap is shifted to higher frequencies due to the fact that the structure is now stiffer ($Y_1^D > Y_1^E$).


\paragraph{$L$ shunt circuit}

In the case of a purely inductive shunt circuit, the impedance is given by $Z_{su} = sL$, and the equation for the mechanical admittance of the piezoelectric patch reduces to:

\begin{equation}
    Y^{SU} = Y_1^D \left( 1 - \frac{k_{31}^2}{1 -\omega^2 C_p^S L} \right)
    \label{eq:mechanical_admittance_R_shunt}
\end{equation}

For the analysis, four values of $L$ are considered while $R$ and $C_N$ are kept constant at $0 \Omega$ and $\infty F$, respectively.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        $R$ [$\Omega$] & $L$ [H] & $C_N$ [F] \\
        \hline
        0              & 0.00    & $\infty$  \\
        0              & 0.02    & $\infty$  \\
        0              & 0.10    & $\infty$  \\
        0              & 1.00    & $\infty$  \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Values of $R$, $L$, and $C_N$ for the purely inductive shunt circuit.}
    \label{tab:RLC_N_values_L_case}
\end{table}

One can also visualize the effect of the inductive element on the system by plotting $Y^{SU}$ for the different values of $L$.

Instead, the dispersion relation of the system are shown in the figures below.

    \label{fig:TMM_ON-ON-ON_RLC_R0_L1_CInf.pdf}
\end{figure}

Based also on Figure \ref{fig:Y_SU_Purely_inductive_shunt_circuit.pdf}, it's possible to observe that at low frequencies the system behaves as in the short circuit case, while at higher frequencies the system behaves as in the open circuit case.
Moreover, the lower $L$, the higher the frequency at which the transition between the two behaviors occurs.
The transition frequency between the two behaviors is given by:

\begin{equation}
    1 - \omega^2 C_p^S L = 0 \rightarrow \omega_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{C_p^S L}}
\end{equation}

When the natural frequency falls within the band-gap, a splitting of the band-gap occurs, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:TMM_ON-ON-ON_RLC_R0_L0.1_CInf.pdf}.
One might use this effect to create an isolated band-pass filter.


\paragraph{$RL$ shunt circuit}

In the case of a resistive-inductive shunt circuit, the impedance is given by $Z_{su} = R + sL$.
The equation for the mechanical admittance of the piezoelectric patch is:

\begin{equation}
    Y^{SU} = Y_1^D \left( 1 - \frac{k_{31}^2}{1 -\omega^2 C_p^S L - s C_p^S R} \right)
    \label{eq:mechanical_admittance_RL_shunt}
\end{equation}

For the analysis, four values of $R$ are considered while $L$ and $C_N$ are kept constant at $0.03 H$ and $\infty F$, respectively.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        $R$ [$\Omega$] & $L$ [H] & $C_N$ [F] \\
        \hline
        0              & 0.03    & $\infty$  \\
        50             & 0.03    & $\infty$  \\
        200            & 0.03    & $\infty$  \\
        1000           & 0.03    & $\infty$  \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Values of $R$, $L$, and $C_N$ for the resistive-inductive shunt circuit.}
    \label{tab:RLC_N_values_RL_case}
\end{table}

One can also visualize the effect of the resistive element on the system by plotting $Y^{SU}$ for the different values of $R$.

\end{figure}

Based also on Figure \ref{fig:Y_SU_Resistive-Inductive_shunt_circuit.pdf}, it's possible to observe that at low frequencies the system behaves as in the short circuit case, while at higher frequencies the system behaves as in the open circuit case, similarly to the purely inductive case.

However, the main difference is that the resistive element $R$ acts as a damping factor, which can be used to control the width and the depth of the band-gap.
This phenomenon is clearly visible in the dispersion relation plots, where the central position of the band-gap remains the same (governed by $L$ only), while the attenuation level decreases with increasing $R$.
For high values of $R$, regardless of the value of $L$, the band-gap can be completely suppressed.



\paragraph{$RC_N$ shunt circuit}

In the case of a resistive-(negative) capacitive shunt circuit, the impedance of the shunt circuit is given by $Z_{su} = R - \frac{1}{sC_N}$.
The equation for the mechanical admittance of the piezoelectric patch is:

\begin{equation}
    Y^{SU} = Y_1^D \left( 1 - \frac{k_{31}^2}{1 - C_p^S \frac{1}{C_N} - s C_p^S R} \right)
    \label{eq:mechanical_admittance_RC_shunt}
\end{equation}

For the analysis, three values of $C_N$ are considered while $R$ and $L$ are kept constant at $1000 \Omega$ and $0H$, respectively.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        $R$ [$\Omega$] & $L$ [H] & $C_N$ [F] \\
        \hline
        1000           & 0       & 30e-9     \\
        1000           & 0       & 7e-9      \\
        1000           & 0       & 5e-9      \\

    \caption{Values of $R$, $L$, and $C_N$ for the resistive-(negative) capacitive shunt circuit.}

\end{figure}

The effect of the negative capacitance is to shift the band-gap frequencies.
Depending on the sign of $1 - C_p^S \frac{1}{C_N}$, the band-gap can be shifted to higher (negative sign) or lower (positive sign) frequencies.
This effect can be used to tune the band-gap to a desired frequency range.

Notice however that the introduction of a negative capacitance can lead to instability issues, as the system can become underdamped.
Not all the configurations shown in the figures above are in fact stable, the purpose of this analysis is to show the effect of the negative capacitance on the system's band-gap and not to provide a stable configuration.
