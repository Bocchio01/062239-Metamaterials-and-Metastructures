\section{Theoretical background}
\label{sec:theoretical_background}

In order to understand the behavior of the system under investigation and the successive analysis performed on it, we need to introduce some theoretical concepts that are used throughout the report.

At first, a brief overview of the transversal wave equation in the case of beam element is given.
Then, the concept of piezoelectric patches is introduced, and the effect of their presence on the beam properties is studied.
Finally, the numerical methods used to solve the wave equation and analyze the system behavior are presented.
