\section{Experimental approach}
\label{sec:experimental_approach}

As shown from a theoretical point of view in Section \ref{sec:analysis_shunted_piezo}, it's possible to control the band-gaps of a beam by means of shunted piezoelectric patches.
Experimental validation has also been performed in this sense and is presented in this section.

At first, the experimental setup is described, highlighting the configuration used for the piezoelectric patches and the shunt circuits.
Then, the experimental data are presented together with the theoretical predictions obtained through the numerical methods presented in Section \ref{subsec:numerical_methods_for_wave_propagation_analysis}.

At first, the space-only modulation is considered, and the tools used for the analysis are the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) and the Plane Wave Expansion Method (PWEM).
\texttt{Comsol Multiphysics} is also adoperated to validate both the numerical methods results and the experimental data.
Then, the space-time modulation is considered, and the nonreciprocal behavior is highlighted showing that the experimental results are in agreement with the theoretical predictions obtained from PWEM.
