  abstract = {The possibility of dissipating mechanical energy with piezoelectric material shunted with passive electrical circuits is investigated. The effective mechanical impedance for the piezoelectric element shunted by an arbitrary circuit is derived. The shunted piezoelectric is shown to possess frequency dependent stiffness and loss factor which are also dependent on the shunting circuit. The generally shunted model is specialized for two shunting circuits: the case of a resistor alone and that of a resistor and inductor. For resistive shunting, the material properties exhibit frequency dependence similar to viscoelastic materials, but are much stiffer and more independent of temperature. Shunting with a resistor and inductor introduces an electrical resonance, which can be optimally tuned to structural resonances in a manner analogous to a mechanical vibration absorber. Techniques for analyzing systems which incorporate these shunting cases are presented and applied to a cantilevered beam experiment. The experimental results for both the resistive and resonant shunting circuits validate the shunted piezoelectric damping models.}
