\begin{frame}{Introduction to nonreciprocity}

    The principle of reciprocity states that the in a linear time-invariant system (LTI), waves propagate from $A$ to $B$ in the same way as from $B$ to $A$.
    The violation of this principle is referred to as \textbf{nonreciprocal} behavior.

    \vspace{9pt}

    One question arise: \textbf{is it possible to design a system that achieves nonreciprocal behavior?}

    % Breaking reciprocity in wave propagation enables the development of one-way communication devices with enhanced performance.

\begin{frame}{Experimental setup}

    The experimental setup\footnotemark[1] is composed of an array of shunted piezoelectric patches spaced $2$ mm apart placed on an aluminum beam substrate.
    Toggling the switches that control the connection between the power supply and each negative capacitance shunting circuit, allows to modulate the substrate properties.

    Out-of-plane velocity field is measured using a Polytec 3D laser Doppler vibrometer.

    By connecting the piezoelectric patches to the beam, the effective properties of the system are modified.
